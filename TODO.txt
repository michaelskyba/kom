- rust rewrite
- recompute summaries
- make a `memory` CLI or something
	for now it can just have some different profiles (simple .md files)
	
	then you just have a `memory append PROFILE TEXT` and `memory compress` and
	`memory read PROFILE`
	or something
	
	or hnt-memory
	
	
	
	then maybe your main memory profile entry can say "read the MAIN-SUBTOPIC
	profile entry to learn more" or something
	and then you append/compress it separately
	
	or maybe a compress just means splitting it out to a different file
- make an alternate output format for hnt-edit
	it will make a copy of all input files and then analyze the diff
	and just kind of write a git diff between all the files
	
	should probably be shorter in general
- make it so hnt-shell has a max amount of tokens it can give
	then it logs the whole message to like /tmp/hnt-shell-1750571344.log
	so the LLM can read it if it really wants
