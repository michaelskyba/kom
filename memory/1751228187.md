Initial state: tasked with fixing hnt-tui select's incorrect output and broken pipe behavior. Will start by exploring the C and Rust source directories.
Debugging 'hnt-tui select'. Incorrect item is returned on selection, and piped input fails. I will start by comparing the C and Rust implementations.
Understood re: testing. I will first analyze the working C implementation in 'util/tui/' before comparing it to the Rust code in 'rust/bins/hnt-tui/'.
Examining 'util/tui/tui-select.c' to understand the correct implementation details before diving into the Rust code.
Identified key C implementation details: using /dev/tty for UI and an atexit hook for cleanup and final output. Hypothesizing Rust version fails due to using stdin for UI and having a flawed cleanup/output sequence. Now inspecting Rust source.
About to inspect the Rust source code for hnt-tui to confirm my hypothesis about TTY and cleanup/output handling.
Reading rust/bins/hnt-tui/src/main.rs to verify my hypotheses regarding TTY handling and program exit logic.
Refactoring hnt-tui select to use /dev/tty for all UI, mirroring the C implementation. This involves adding the termios crate, creating a new Tty struct to manage the terminal, rewriting the input loop to read from the tty directly, and sending all UI drawing to the tty instead of stdout.
Refactoring of hnt-tui complete. It now uses /dev/tty for UI, mirroring the C implementation. Building the project to confirm it compiles.
Build failed due to trait ambiguity on File handle with crossterm::execute. I'll fix this by introducing a 'TtyWriter' newtype that only implements std::io::Write, and will also remove an 'unused_mut' warning.
The previous hnt-edit command failed due to a pathing issue. I am re-running it with the corrected relative file path 'src/main.rs' to apply the fix for the E0034 compilation error.
The TtyWriter newtype has been added to resolve trait ambiguity and the unused_mut warning is fixed. I am now rebuilding the project.
The build succeeded. I am now confident the bugs are fixed. Requesting user to test interactive selection and piped output assignment scenarios.
The selected item isn't visible in the terminal after selection. The `Clear(ClearType::FromCursorDown)` in the `Drop` implementation is too aggressive. I will replace it with a more precise, line-by-line cleanup that mimics the C version, ensuring the final output is not overwritten by the shell prompt.
The Drop implementation has been updated for more precise cleanup. Rebuilding the project now.
The build with the refined Drop implementation was successful. The visual glitch should be fixed. I am now awaiting the user's final test result.
The selected output is not visible because `println!` is called while the terminal is still in raw mode. I will fix this by wrapping the TUI logic in a new scope to force `tui` to be dropped *before* `println!`, and I will also simplify the now-unnecessary complex drop logic.
The fix for the raw mode printing issue has been applied. Building the code now.
All bugs fixed. The hnt-tui select tool is now working perfectly, matching the C version's behavior. The project is complete.
