Initial state: Rust TUI has rendering/clearing issues. Comparing C and Rust source to find discrepancies, starting with file listings.
Investigating C implementation in tui-pane.c to understand correct terminal handling before debugging the Rust version.
C code analysis complete. Hypothesizing bugs in Rust's screen clearing (CSI J/K), color handling (CSI m), or rendering logic. Now examining the Rust source in src/main.rs.
Rust 'draw_pane' is buggy. Rewriting it with hnt-edit to cache terminal attributes, batch commands with queue!, and correctly render empty cells to fix flicker and clearing issues.
hnt-edit patched draw_pane. Now compiling the changes with 'cargo build' to see if the fix is successful.
Compilation failed due to a String vs &str type mismatch. Fixing by replacing '""' with 'String::new()' in the else branch.
Type mismatch hopefully fixed. Re-running cargo build to confirm.
