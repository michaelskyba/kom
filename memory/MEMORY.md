Starting the rewrite of './agent/headless/' Python code into Rust. My first step is to explore the Python code to understand its functionality.
FD failed because the path 'agent/headless/' was incorrect. I'll list the contents of the 'agent' directory to find the correct path.
Messed up the 'fd' command. The '-d' flag needs a number. Now, I'm listing files in the 'agent' directory to figure out its structure.
Found the 'agent/headlesh/' directory. I'll check out the C code inside to see how it works.
Analyzed the C code for `headlesh`. It's a client-server shell session manager using FIFOs. Now, I'll inspect the existing Rust project in ./rust to see how to best integrate this functionality.
Setting up a new Rust binary crate 'headlesh' to replicate the C version's functionality. First step: create the directory structure and scaffolding for the new crate.
Populating the new 'headlesh' crate. I'll configure Cargo.toml with necessary dependencies like clap and tokio, then set up the basic CLI structure in main.rs using clap.
The agent's initial setup is good, but I need to fix some errors. I'm correcting the binary name in Cargo.toml and will then fix the command-line arguments in main.rs.
Package name fixed. Now, I'm updating 'main.rs' to make 'session_id' a required positional argument for the 'create', 'exec', and 'exit' commands.
CLI arguments are fixed. Now, I'll add the 'headlesh' crate to the workspace and compile to verify the setup.
Adding 'bins/headlesh' to the workspace members in the root Cargo.toml.
Added 'headlesh' to the workspace. Compiling the project now to check for errors and to cache the new dependencies.
