Starting the rewrite of './agent/headless/' Python code into Rust. My first step is to explore the Python code to understand its functionality.
FD failed because the path 'agent/headless/' was incorrect. I'll list the contents of the 'agent' directory to find the correct path.
Messed up the 'fd' command. The '-d' flag needs a number. Now, I'm listing files in the 'agent' directory to figure out its structure.
Found the 'agent/headlesh/' directory. I'll check out the C code inside to see how it works.
Analyzed the C code for `headlesh`. It's a client-server shell session manager using FIFOs. Now, I'll inspect the existing Rust project in ./rust to see how to best integrate this functionality.
Setting up a new Rust binary crate 'headlesh' to replicate the C version's functionality. First step: create the directory structure and scaffolding for the new crate.
Populating the new 'headlesh' crate. I'll configure Cargo.toml with necessary dependencies like clap and tokio, then set up the basic CLI structure in main.rs using clap.
The agent's initial setup is good, but I need to fix some errors. I'm correcting the binary name in Cargo.toml and will then fix the command-line arguments in main.rs.
Package name fixed. Now, I'm updating 'main.rs' to make 'session_id' a required positional argument for the 'create', 'exec', and 'exit' commands.
CLI arguments are fixed. Now, I'll add the 'headlesh' crate to the workspace and compile to verify the setup.
Adding 'bins/headlesh' to the workspace members in the root Cargo.toml.
Added 'headlesh' to the workspace. Compiling the project now to check for errors and to cache the new dependencies.
Starting implementation of the 'list' subcommand. I will add logic to read session directories, parse PID files, and check for active processes. This will establish the foundation for session management.
hnt-edit failed due to an incorrect path. I was in the 'rust' directory but provided a path from the project root. I will now re-run the command with the correct relative path.
Testing the newly implemented 'list' command. I expect it to run without error and produce no output, as there are no active sessions yet.
Compilation failed because of missing 'nix' features. I'm adding the 'signal' and 'process' features to the 'headlesh' crate's Cargo.toml to resolve this.
Enabled necessary 'nix' features. Retrying the compile and run of the 'list' command.
Starting implementation of the 'create' command. My first step is to handle session directory creation, file locking, and daemonization. I'll add placeholders for the FIFO and shell logic.
The 'create' command scaffold is good, but I need to add the missing dependencies: 'fslock', 'simplelog', and 'dirs' to Cargo.toml.
Dependencies added. Now testing 'create' command by creating 'test-session', verifying with 'list', and checking the log file.
Correcting compilation errors. First, adding the 'log' crate to Cargo.toml.
Adding the 'log' dependency didn't fix everything. Now I'm fixing compiler errors in main.rs by correcting the LockFile::open call and reordering the file handling to open with std::fs::File before locking with fslock to write the PID.
The agent messed up the 'try_lock' call. I'm fixing it to the simpler, correct 'lock.try_lock().is_err()' and removing the unnecessary prelude use statement.
Code corrected. I'm now compiling and running the 'create' command, expecting it to succeed.
Switching from 'fslock' to 'fs2' for file locking to allow writing to the locked PID file. I will update Cargo.toml and main.rs to implement this change.
Replaced 'fslock' with 'fs2'. Now compiling and testing the 'create' command again.
Session 'test-session' is up and running. Now, I'm checking the logs to verify everything's working as expected.
