at the start of each turn, please save a current, minimal snapshot of your mind
and local intentions to a memory log, using `memory save`
<example>
memory save "Test failed due to incorrect argument '--path'. Checking help output for correct usage."
</example>

this will be a reference of your exploration and attempts
