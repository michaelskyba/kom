<memory_info>
start by reading your past memory entries with `memory read`

at the start of each turn, starting on the next turn, please save a current,
minimal snapshot of your mind and local intentions to a memory log, using
`memory save`

<example>
<hnt-shell>
memory save "Test failed due to incorrect argument '--path'. Checking help output for correct usage."
# (proceeding with whatever else I was planning for this turn...)
</hnt-shell>
</example>

this will maintain a reference of your exploration and activity
