Initial state: Rust TUI has rendering/clearing issues. Comparing C and Rust source to find discrepancies, starting with file listings.
Investigating C implementation in tui-pane.c to understand correct terminal handling before debugging the Rust version.
C code analysis complete. Hypothesizing bugs in Rust's screen clearing (CSI J/K), color handling (CSI m), or rendering logic. Now examining the Rust source in src/main.rs.
Rust 'draw_pane' is buggy. Rewriting it with hnt-edit to cache terminal attributes, batch commands with queue!, and correctly render empty cells to fix flicker and clearing issues.
hnt-edit patched draw_pane. Now compiling the changes with 'cargo build' to see if the fix is successful.
Compilation failed due to a String vs &str type mismatch. Fixing by replacing '""' with 'String::new()' in the else branch.
Type mismatch hopefully fixed. Re-running cargo build to confirm.
Compilation successful. Awaiting user feedback on whether the rendering and clearing issues are fixed.
Fixing cursor and underline bugs. Plan: 1) Respect vt100's cursor visibility state. 2) Skip rendering of double-width character placeholders.
Patched cursor and double-width char bugs. Compiling now before handing off for testing.
Compilation failed on hallucinated methods. Using sed to convert cursor_visible() and double_width_holder() to field access, then recompiling.
Compilation failed due to incorrect API usage for the 'vt100' crate. I will now determine the crate version and request online documentation.
Requesting online research for 'vt100' crate v0.15.2 API to find correct methods for cursor visibility and double-width character checks.
Using research results to fix vt100 API calls. Replacing `cursor_visible` with `!screen.hide_cursor()` and `double_width_holder` with `is_wide_continuation()`.
Patched vt100 API calls using correct methods. Recompiling.
Compilation successful with correct vt100 API. Awaiting user feedback on cursor and underline bug fixes.
Attribute bleeding issue identified. Rewriting rendering logic in `draw_pane` to reset and reapply styles for each cell change, mirroring the more robust C implementation.
Style logic refactored to reset/reapply attributes. Compiling the changes.
Fixing pane placement regression. Rewriting TuiPane::new to query cursor position, calculate start row, and scroll if needed, mimicking the C implementation.
Pane placement logic has been rewritten. Compiling the code now for testing.
Fixing process exit hang. Rewriting the `run_pane` event loop to use PTY EOF as the exit signal, removing the `child.wait()` race condition, and ensuring proper cleanup.
Exit logic refactored to fix hang. Compiling code for final testing.
Fixing process exit deadlock. Refactoring `run_pane` to move stdin reading to a separate blocking task with its own channel, making the main 'select!' loop purely async.
Major refactor of `run_pane` to prevent deadlocks is complete. Compiling the new version now.
Final build is ready after major refactor. Awaiting user feedback on the exit deadlock fix.
Identified a post-loop deadlock. The master PTY must be closed before waiting for the child. Adding `drop(pty_writer)` to fix this.
Added `drop(pty_writer)` before `child.wait()` to resolve exit deadlock. Compiling for what should be the final test.
Deep deadlock identified: the original 'master' PTY object was not being dropped. Adding `drop(master)` before the wait to finally close the PTY.
Identified the final deadlock cause: failure to send SIGTERM. Mirroring C logic by adding `child.kill()` before PTY cleanup and `wait()`.
Final attempt to fix exit deadlock by adding `child.kill()`. Compiling for final test.
