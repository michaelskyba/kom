Initial state: Rust TUI has rendering/clearing issues. Comparing C and Rust source to find discrepancies, starting with file listings.
Investigating C implementation in tui-pane.c to understand correct terminal handling before debugging the Rust version.
C code analysis complete. Hypothesizing bugs in Rust's screen clearing (CSI J/K), color handling (CSI m), or rendering logic. Now examining the Rust source in src/main.rs.
Rust 'draw_pane' is buggy. Rewriting it with hnt-edit to cache terminal attributes, batch commands with queue!, and correctly render empty cells to fix flicker and clearing issues.
hnt-edit patched draw_pane. Now compiling the changes with 'cargo build' to see if the fix is successful.
Compilation failed due to a String vs &str type mismatch. Fixing by replacing '""' with 'String::new()' in the else branch.
Type mismatch hopefully fixed. Re-running cargo build to confirm.
Compilation successful. Awaiting user feedback on whether the rendering and clearing issues are fixed.
Fixing cursor and underline bugs. Plan: 1) Respect vt100's cursor visibility state. 2) Skip rendering of double-width character placeholders.
Patched cursor and double-width char bugs. Compiling now before handing off for testing.
Compilation failed on hallucinated methods. Using sed to convert cursor_visible() and double_width_holder() to field access, then recompiling.
Compilation failed due to incorrect API usage for the 'vt100' crate. I will now determine the crate version and request online documentation.
Requesting online research for 'vt100' crate v0.15.2 API to find correct methods for cursor visibility and double-width character checks.
Using research results to fix vt100 API calls. Replacing `cursor_visible` with `!screen.hide_cursor()` and `double_width_holder` with `is_wide_continuation()`.
Patched vt100 API calls using correct methods. Recompiling.
Compilation successful with correct vt100 API. Awaiting user feedback on cursor and underline bug fixes.
Attribute bleeding issue identified. Rewriting rendering logic in `draw_pane` to reset and reapply styles for each cell change, mirroring the more robust C implementation.
Style logic refactored to reset/reapply attributes. Compiling the changes.
Fixing pane placement regression. Rewriting TuiPane::new to query cursor position, calculate start row, and scroll if needed, mimicking the C implementation.
Pane placement logic has been rewritten. Compiling the code now for testing.
Fixing process exit hang. Rewriting the `run_pane` event loop to use PTY EOF as the exit signal, removing the `child.wait()` race condition, and ensuring proper cleanup.
Exit logic refactored to fix hang. Compiling code for final testing.
Fixing process exit deadlock. Refactoring `run_pane` to move stdin reading to a separate blocking task with its own channel, making the main 'select!' loop purely async.
Major refactor of `run_pane` to prevent deadlocks is complete. Compiling the new version now.
Final build is ready after major refactor. Awaiting user feedback on the exit deadlock fix.
Identified a post-loop deadlock. The master PTY must be closed before waiting for the child. Adding `drop(pty_writer)` to fix this.
Added `drop(pty_writer)` before `child.wait()` to resolve exit deadlock. Compiling for what should be the final test.
Deep deadlock identified: the original 'master' PTY object was not being dropped. Adding `drop(master)` before the wait to finally close the PTY.
Identified the final deadlock cause: failure to send SIGTERM. Mirroring C logic by adding `child.kill()` before PTY cleanup and `wait()`.
Final attempt to fix exit deadlock by adding `child.kill()`. Compiling for final test.
Debugging delayed exit in 'hnt-tui pane' Rust rewrite. The C version exits cleanly. I will start by inspecting the C code's exit logic.
Inspecting 'tui-pane.c' to understand its clean exit mechanism, which I will then replicate in the Rust version.
The C code's clean exit relies on detecting EOF from the child's PTY, which triggers `waitpid` and restores terminal settings. I suspect the Rust version is failing to restore the terminal from raw mode.
The C code's clean exit relies on detecting EOF from the child's PTY, which triggers `waitpid` and restores terminal settings. I suspect the Rust version is failing to restore the terminal from raw mode.
Now inspecting 'main.rs' to find the event loop and exit handling. I'm looking for failures in detecting child exit or restoring terminal state, which I suspect is the root cause of the hang.
Refactoring Rust's 'run_pane' to exit on PTY EOF, like the C version, instead of using a separate 'child.wait()' task. This should fix the exit hang.
Code patched. Now compiling the Rust binary in release mode to test the fix for the exit hang.
The previous fix stalled the async runtime. The new plan is to correctly reap the child process using `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` after the main loop exits, ensuring a clean shutdown and terminal restoration.
Previous command failed due to incorrect path. Now retrying the edit to `src/main.rs` with the correct relative path to fix the child process reaping logic.
Code has been patched to correctly handle child process termination in a non-blocking way. Compiling the final binary for testing.
Previous fixes stalled the async runtime. The new plan fires-and-forgets a background task to reap the child process, allowing the main function to return immediately and restore the terminal state.
Code patched to fire-and-forget a child-reaping task. This allows the main function to return instantly, triggering the terminal-restore logic in the TuiPane destructor. Compiling for final test.
The implicit Drop is not reliable. I will create an explicit `cleanup()` method for TuiPane and call it immediately after the child exits, before dealing with process reaping in the background. This should fix the terminal hang.
Code refactored to use an explicit cleanup() method for terminal restoration, which is now called immediately after the child process exits. This should fix the hang. Compiling for final test.
The stdin read is likely blocking the event loop. Refactoring `run_pane` to move stdin to a dedicated blocking task with channel communication. Adding comprehensive logging to trace the execution flow and diagnose any hangs.
Command failed due to shell parsing error. Retrying with safer instructions. The plan is still to move the stdin read to a dedicated blocking task and add comprehensive logging to diagnose the hang.
I forgot to recompile after the last edit. I must now build the binary with the new logging and non-blocking I/O architecture before asking the user to test again.
The user reports that pressing Enter creates a new log line, which is a critical clue. I will now examine the log file to see which part of the code is executing on each key press.
The pty_writer being held open is preventing PTY EOF, blocking the reader task. The fix is to use a dedicated task to 'child.wait()' directly and signal the main loop to exit, bypassing the PTY reader for termination logic.
Code patched to use a dedicated task for child process waiting, signaling the main loop via a channel. This avoids the PTY deadlock. Compiling for final test.
The log shows the stdin reader task is blocking final shutdown. The plan is to get the full log, then modify the code to explicitly abort the stdin reader task after the main event loop exits.
The log confirms the stdin reader task is blocking shutdown. The final fix is to store a handle to this task and explicitly call its .abort() method as soon as the main loop exits.
Final patch applied to abort the blocking stdin reader task. This should allow for a clean, immediate shutdown. Compiling for final test.
The runtime is waiting for the stdin thread, which is stuck in a blocking read and cannot be aborted. The final solution is to force process exit with `std::process::exit(0)` immediately after terminal cleanup.
User correctly pointed out I failed to compile the last change. I will now compile the version with the `std::process::exit(0)` fix and await the user's test results.
