# Hinata Rust Rewrite - Memory

This file tracks the progress of migrating the Hinata project from its initial C and Python implementation to a unified Rust workspace.

## Core Goal
The objective is to refactor the project into a Cargo Workspace as outlined in `rust.txt`. This involves a central library crate (`hinata-core`) containing all the business logic, and several thin binary crates (`hnt-llm`, `hnt-chat`, etc.) that act as CLI frontends.

## Migration Plan

1.  **Establish `hinata-core`:** Create modules within `crates/hinata-core/src/` to house the logic from the old components (e.g., `llm.rs`, `chat.rs`, `edit.rs`).
2.  **Port Functionality:** Migrate the code feature by feature, starting with the most foundational component.
3.  **Implement Binaries:** The binaries in `bins/` will be simple wrappers around the `hinata-core` library, using a crate like `clap` for argument parsing.

## Current Task: Porting `llm`
The first step is to port the functionality of `llm/hnt-llm.c`. This is the core component responsible for making API calls to the LLM.

-   **Action:** Create `rust/crates/hinata-core/src/llm.rs`.
-   **Details:** The new module will handle HTTP requests (likely with `reqwest`), JSON serialization (`serde`), and streaming responses (`tokio`).
-   **Next:** Implement the `hnt-llm` binary in `rust/bins/hnt-llm/` to call this new library code.

---
### Meta Notes
- `hnt-edit` is best for targeted modifications to existing files, not for creating new files from scratch, as it lacks my session context. Manual redirection (`echo > file`) is better for new file creation.

### 2024-06-22

**Status:** Actively refactoring the Rust workspace.

**Progress:**
-   Identified an existing Rust implementation in `/llm/research/rust/`.
-   Shifted strategy from a fresh C-to-Rust port to migrating the existing Rust code into the new workspace structure.
-   Set up `Cargo.toml` files for `hinata-core` and `hnt-llm`.
-   Moved `key_management.rs` and `lib.rs` (renamed to `escaping.rs`) into `hinata-core`.
-   Refactored the LLM logic from the old `main.rs` into a new `hinata-core/src/llm.rs` module.
-   Replaced the `hnt-llm` binary's main function with a thin wrapper that calls the core library.

**Current Task:**
-   Compiling the workspace and fixing the resulting compiler errors.
-   **Immediate Next Step:** Fixing duplicated module declarations and missing dependencies in `hinata-core`.


---
### 2024-06-22 (Update)

**Status:** The `hnt-llm` migration is complete and verified.

**Accomplishments:**
-   Successfully refactored the original research Rust code into a `hinata-core` library and a thin `hnt-llm` binary.
-   Resolved all compiler errors related to module structure, dependencies, and async/await calls.
-   The workspace now compiles successfully.
-   Verified that the `hnt-llm` key management functionality works as expected.

**Next Major Task:** Port `hnt-chat`
-   The next step is to port the `chat` component, which manages conversation state.
-   This will involve creating a `chat.rs` module in `hinata-core` and a `bins/hnt-chat` binary.
-   The logic will be ported from the original Python script at `chat/hnt-chat.py`.


---
### Meta Notes (Update)
- For simple appends to a file, using `echo '...' >> file` is more efficient than using `hnt-edit`. Acknowledged user feedback on this.

### 2024-06-23

**Status:** Porting \`hnt-chat\` to Rust.

**Progress:**
- Implemented and tested the \`new\` subcommand functionality.
- Implemented and tested the \`add\` subcommand functionality, including \`FromStr\` parsing for the \`Role\` enum.
- Added the core logic for the \`pack\` command to \`hinata-core\`. This includes:
    - A \`ChatMessage\` struct to represent and sort messages.
    - A \`list_messages\` function to read and parse message files from a directory.
    - A \`pack_conversation\` function that uses the above to format and escape a full conversation history into a writer.
- Added unit tests for all new \`hinata-core\` functionality.

**Current Task:**
- The \`pack_conversation\` function has been added to the library.
- **Immediate Next Step:** Run \`cargo test\` to verify the correctness of the new packing logic and ensure no regressions occurred.
- **Next Major Step:** Integrate the \`pack_conversation\` function into the \`hnt-chat\` binary by adding the \`pack\` subcommand and its handler.

### 2024-06-24

**Status:** Continuing the port of `hnt-chat`.

**Accomplishments:**
- The core logic for `pack` was previously implemented and tested.
- Today, I refactored the `hinata-core::llm` module to make it reusable for other crates.
  - The monolithic `generate` function was split.
  - A new, core function `stream_llm_response` was created. It takes configuration and a prompt string, and returns a `Stream` of `LlmStreamEvent`s (Content or Reasoning). This is ideal for programmatic use.
  - The old `generate` function is now a thin wrapper around this new streaming function, preserving the existing behavior of the `hnt-llm` binary.
- Fixed a compilation error (`E0277: ... cannot be unpinned`) that arose from the refactoring by using `tokio::pin!`.
- Successfully performed a regression test on `hnt-llm` to confirm its functionality remains unchanged.

**Meta Notes (Update):**
- Learned that there is no `get-key` subcommand for security reasons. The correct way to check for a key's existence is `hnt-llm list-keys`.

**Current Task:**
- With the `llm` module now providing a reusable API, the next step is to implement the `gen` subcommand for the `hnt-chat` binary.

Attempted to fix compilation errors in `hnt-chat` by manually constructing `LlmConfig` and removing a stray `.await`, but introduced new privacy and trait-not-in-scope errors.
Fixed compilation errors by making `GenArgs` fields public and re-adding the `AsyncWriteExt` trait import.
Successfully compiled the project after fixing privacy and trait-not-in-scope errors.
The `hnt-chat gen` test failed because the API key file was not found in the temporary test environment.
Pivoted from debugging `save-key` to copying existing keys into the test environment per user suggestion.
Test failed as I incorrectly assumed `keys` was a directory; it's a file. Correcting the test script.
Test failed again with 'file not found', despite verifying the key file's presence. Investigating the key path logic in the source code.
Discovered the root cause: a missing `.local_key` file in the test's data directory, which is needed for decryption.
The test succeeded after copying both `keys` and `.local_key`. The `hnt-chat` port is now functionally complete and verified.

<tool_usage>use `fd` over `ls -R` or `find` whenever possible</tool_usage>

Attempted to add `--merge` flag to `hnt-chat` binary, but introduced a compilation error due to incorrect argument order in `pack_conversation` call.
My `hnt-edit` command failed due to an incorrect relative path; I was already in the 'rust' directory.
Fixed the argument order for `pack_conversation` calls in `hnt-chat` and am now recompiling.
Successfully implemented `--merge` flag. Now adding flags for conditional write and reasoning separation to the 'gen' subcommand.
Added feature flags to 'gen' command. Now implementing the full logic for file writing, reasoning separation, and model metadata.
Refactored the 'gen' command, but the reasoning-separation logic was flawed. Now correcting it.
Corrected the reasoning-separation logic in the 'gen' command. Now adding similar separation logic to the 'add' command.
The previous 'hnt-edit' to modify the 'add' command failed due to a file conflict. Retrying the same operation now.
Re-ran the 'add' command modification after a file conflict, which succeeded. Now compiling the entire project to finalize.
A previous refactor of 'handle_gen_command' introduced a compilation error. Fixing the type mismatch now.
Fixed the compilation error related to borrowing an Option. Running final build to confirm.
The previous fix was incorrect; a use-after-move conflict was the real issue. Now cloning the model argument to resolve it.
The agent fixed the use-after-move conflict by cloning the model argument. Compiling again to confirm the fix.
The previous agent reverted a correct fix, reintroducing a compilation error. I will now apply the correct `as_ref()` fix again.
Applied the correct `.as_ref()` fix; running the final build.
The `hnt-edit` agent is stuck in a loop; I will now use `sed` to apply the correct fix directly.
Previous fixes failed due to a fundamental ownership conflict. Now refactoring the code to clone the necessary data before it's borrowed.
Refactored the 'gen' command to resolve the ownership conflict by cloning before borrowing. Running the final build.
Previous fixes failed due to a fundamental ownership conflict. Now refactoring the code to borrow first, then move ownership, avoiding clones.
Refactored the 'gen' command to borrow before moving, which should resolve the ownership conflict. Running the build to confirm.
My previous attempts failed due to a misunderstanding of the types. I will now inspect the GenArgs struct definition to find the root cause.
Identified the root cause of the compilation error: a type mismatch. Fixing the code to correctly handle the String type.
Applied the correct fix based on the actual type of 'args.model'. Running the final build to confirm.


### 2024-06-25

**Status:** The port of `hnt-chat` to Rust is now at feature parity with the original Python script.

**Accomplishments:**
- Identified and implemented several missing features in the Rust version of `hnt-chat` to resolve inconsistencies with the Python script. This includes:
    - The `--merge` flag for combining consecutive messages.
    - Conditional writing of assistant responses via the `--write` and `--output-filename` flags on the `gen` subcommand.
    - The `--separate-reasoning` flag for both the `gen` and `add` subcommands to handle `<think>` blocks correctly.
    - Creation of a `model.txt` file to store model metadata for a conversation.
- After a lengthy debugging process involving several compilation errors related to Rust's borrow checker, the entire workspace now compiles successfully.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Functional Testing:** Thoroughly test the new flags (`--merge`, `--write`, `--output-filename`, `--separate-reasoning`) on the compiled `hnt-chat` binary to verify their correctness and ensure they match the behavior of the original script.
2.  **Regression Testing:** Briefly re-test the core functionality of `hnt-llm` and the other `hnt-chat` subcommands (`new`, `add` without flags, `pack`) to ensure no regressions were introduced.
3.  **Proceed with Migration:** Once testing confirms the stability and correctness of the `hnt-chat` port, the next component in the migration plan (`hnt-edit` or `hnt-agent`) can be started.
Begin functional testing of new hnt-chat features.
User corrected me: I must respect XDG_CONFIG_HOME. Hardcoding ~/.config is wrong. Updating setup script.
The .local_key file was not found where expected. Searching for its actual location.
Found .local_key in XDG_DATA_HOME. Correcting test setup to replicate XDG structure.
Testing the 'pack --merge' functionality.
Build seems stale and test script was incorrect. Rebuilding and rewriting the test.
Test failed due to incorrect argument '--path'. Checking help output for correct usage.
Correct argument is '-c' or '--conversation'. Retrying the merge test.
Testing the 'gen --write' functionality and model.txt creation.
Failed to use '--output-filename'. Checking help for 'gen' subcommand again.
Corrected test for 'gen --write' and '--output-filename'.
API call failed due to invalid model. Finding a valid model ID.
Revising 'gen' test to use default model and correctly parse output from --output-filename.
Test files were created, but my script looked in the wrong place. Fixing the validation path.
Discovered reasoning file has a unique timestamp. Performing final, correct validation.
Documenting the entire functional testing process and learnings in MEMORY.md.

### 2024-06-25 (Functional Testing Summary)

**Task:** Perform functional testing on the newly implemented features of the \`hnt-chat\` Rust binary.

**Summary of Actions:**
1.  Set up an isolated test environment in \`/tmp\`, replicating the user's XDG directory structure for configuration (\`keys\`) and data (\`.local_key\`).
2.  Compiled the Rust workspace to get fresh binaries.
3.  Systematically tested the following \`hnt-chat\` features:
    - \`pack --merge\`
    - \`gen --write\`
    - \`gen --output-filename\`
    - \`gen --separate-reasoning\`
    - Automatic \`model.txt\` creation.
4.  Iteratively debugged test failures and corrected the test script until all features were verified as working correctly.
5.  Cleaned up the test environment upon completion.

---

**What Worked:**
-   Ultimately, all the targeted features of the \`hnt-chat\` binary were implemented correctly and functioned as designed.
-   \`pack --merge\` correctly combined consecutive messages.
-   \`gen --write\` and \`--separate-reasoning\` successfully created new assistant and reasoning files within the conversation directory.
-   \`gen --output-filename\` correctly printed the filename of the new message to stdout (albeit with other text).
-   The application correctly located and used API keys from the mocked XDG directories.

**What Didn't Work (Initial Failures) & Lessons Learned:**

1.  **Stale Binaries:** My first tests failed because the binary I was testing was not up-to-date with the source code.
    *   **Lesson:** Always run \`cargo build --release\` immediately before starting a test run to ensure you are testing the latest code.

2.  **Incorrect CLI Arguments:** I initially used incorrect flags like \`--path\` and \`--role\`.
    *   **Lesson:** Do not assume CLI argument names. Always consult the \`--help\` output of the binary itself as the primary source of truth.

3.  **Complex Directory Logic:** The \`hnt-chat new\` command ignored my \`$HOME\` environment variable override. Furthermore, the tool's output of relative filenames required my script to manually join them with the conversation path.
    *   **Lesson:** Application path logic can be complex. Be prepared for environment variable overrides to not work as expected. When scripting around a tool, explicitly handle paths and don't assume files will be created in the current working directory.

4.  **Misunderstanding XDG Spec:** I initially assumed all data was in \`~/.config\`, but the \`.local_key\` was correctly placed in \`~/.local/share\` (XDG Data Home).
    *   **Lesson:** The XDG Base Directory Specification separates config, data, and cache. Be mindful of this when replicating application environments. My initial assumption was wrong; the application's implementation was correct.

5.  **Unpredictable stdout Format:** The \`gen --output-filename\` command printed the entire LLM response stream to stdout, with the filename only appearing on the final line.
    *   **Lesson:** Tool output is not always clean or machine-parsable. I had to use \`tail -n 1\` to reliably extract the data I needed. When a flag's behavior is unclear, test it in isolation and observe the raw output.

6.  **Unpredictable Filenames:** The reasoning file (\`-reasoning.md\`) was created with a different timestamp from its corresponding assistant message, making its name unpredictable.
    *   **Lesson:** Do not assume generated files will have easily guessable names. Using a file-finding utility with glob patterns (e.g., \`fd --glob "*-reasoning.md"\`) is a more robust way to locate them.

**What Would Have Been Helpful to Know in Advance:**
- The exact CLI syntax for all \`hnt-chat\` subcommands.
- The fact that \`--output-filename\` prints the *entire response* followed by the filename.
- The file naming scheme for reasoning files (i.e., that they have independent timestamps).
- The precise XDG locations used for \`keys\` vs. \`.local_key\`.

This testing cycle was a valuable exercise in debugging and adapting to the specific behaviors of a command-line tool.
