# Hinata Rust Rewrite - Memory

This file tracks the progress of migrating the Hinata project from its initial C and Python implementation to a unified Rust workspace.

## Core Goal
The objective is to refactor the project into a Cargo Workspace as outlined in `rust.txt`. This involves a central library crate (`hinata-core`) containing all the business logic, and several thin binary crates (`hnt-llm`, `hnt-chat`, etc.) that act as CLI frontends.

## Migration Plan

1.  **Establish `hinata-core`:** Create modules within `crates/hinata-core/src/` to house the logic from the old components (e.g., `llm.rs`, `chat.rs`, `edit.rs`).
2.  **Port Functionality:** Migrate the code feature by feature, starting with the most foundational component.
3.  **Implement Binaries:** The binaries in `bins/` will be simple wrappers around the `hinata-core` library, using a crate like `clap` for argument parsing.

## Current Task: Porting `llm`
The first step is to port the functionality of `llm/hnt-llm.c`. This is the core component responsible for making API calls to the LLM.

-   **Action:** Create `rust/crates/hinata-core/src/llm.rs`.
-   **Details:** The new module will handle HTTP requests (likely with `reqwest`), JSON serialization (`serde`), and streaming responses (`tokio`).
-   **Next:** Implement the `hnt-llm` binary in `rust/bins/hnt-llm/` to call this new library code.

### Meta Notes
- `hnt-edit` is best for targeted modifications to existing files, not for creating new files from scratch, as it lacks my session context. Manual redirection (`echo > file`) is better for new file creation.

**Status:** Actively refactoring the Rust workspace.

**Progress:**
-   Identified an existing Rust implementation in `/llm/research/rust/`.
-   Shifted strategy from a fresh C-to-Rust port to migrating the existing Rust code into the new workspace structure.
-   Set up `Cargo.toml` files for `hinata-core` and `hnt-llm`.
-   Moved `key_management.rs` and `lib.rs` (renamed to `escaping.rs`) into `hinata-core`.
-   Refactored the LLM logic from the old `main.rs` into a new `hinata-core/src/llm.rs` module.
-   Replaced the `hnt-llm` binary's main function with a thin wrapper that calls the core library.

**Current Task:**
-   Compiling the workspace and fixing the resulting compiler errors.
-   **Immediate Next Step:** Fixing duplicated module declarations and missing dependencies in `hinata-core`.

### 2024-06-22 (Update)

**Status:** The `hnt-llm` migration is complete and verified.

**Accomplishments:**
-   Successfully refactored the original research Rust code into a `hinata-core` library and a thin `hnt-llm` binary.
-   Resolved all compiler errors related to module structure, dependencies, and async/await calls.
-   The workspace now compiles successfully.
-   Verified that the `hnt-llm` key management functionality works as expected.

**Next Major Task:** Port `hnt-chat`
-   The next step is to port the `chat` component, which manages conversation state.
-   This will involve creating a `chat.rs` module in `hinata-core` and a `bins/hnt-chat` binary.
-   The logic will be ported from the original Python script at `chat/hnt-chat.py`.

### Meta Notes (Update)
- For simple appends to a file, using `echo '...' >> file` is more efficient than using `hnt-edit`. Acknowledged user feedback on this.

**Status:** Porting \`hnt-chat\` to Rust.

**Progress:**
- Implemented and tested the \`new\` subcommand functionality.
- Implemented and tested the \`add\` subcommand functionality, including \`FromStr\` parsing for the \`Role\` enum.
- Added the core logic for the \`pack\` command to \`hinata-core\`. This includes:
    - A \`ChatMessage\` struct to represent and sort messages.
    - A \`list_messages\` function to read and parse message files from a directory.
    - A \`pack_conversation\` function that uses the above to format and escape a full conversation history into a writer.
- Added unit tests for all new \`hinata-core\` functionality.

**Current Task:**
- The \`pack_conversation\` function has been added to the library.
- **Immediate Next Step:** Run \`cargo test\` to verify the correctness of the new packing logic and ensure no regressions occurred.
- **Next Major Step:** Integrate the \`pack_conversation\` function into the \`hnt-chat\` binary by adding the \`pack\` subcommand and its handler.

**Status:** Continuing the port of `hnt-chat`.

**Accomplishments:**
- The core logic for `pack` was previously implemented and tested.
- Today, I refactored the `hinata-core::llm` module to make it reusable for other crates.
  - The monolithic `generate` function was split.
  - A new, core function `stream_llm_response` was created. It takes configuration and a prompt string, and returns a `Stream` of `LlmStreamEvent`s (Content or Reasoning). This is ideal for programmatic use.
  - The old `generate` function is now a thin wrapper around this new streaming function, preserving the existing behavior of the `hnt-llm` binary.
- Fixed a compilation error (`E0277: ... cannot be unpinned`) that arose from the refactoring by using `tokio::pin!`.
- Successfully performed a regression test on `hnt-llm` to confirm its functionality remains unchanged.

**Meta Notes (Update):**
- Learned that there is no `get-key` subcommand for security reasons. The correct way to check for a key's existence is `hnt-llm list-keys`.

**Current Task:**
- With the `llm` module now providing a reusable API, the next step is to implement the `gen` subcommand for the `hnt-chat` binary.

Attempted to fix compilation errors in `hnt-chat` by manually constructing `LlmConfig` and removing a stray `.await`, but introduced new privacy and trait-not-in-scope errors.
Fixed compilation errors by making `GenArgs` fields public and re-adding the `AsyncWriteExt` trait import.
Successfully compiled the project after fixing privacy and trait-not-in-scope errors.
The `hnt-chat gen` test failed because the API key file was not found in the temporary test environment.
Pivoted from debugging `save-key` to copying existing keys into the test environment per user suggestion.
Test failed as I incorrectly assumed `keys` was a directory; it's a file. Correcting the test script.
Test failed again with 'file not found', despite verifying the key file's presence. Investigating the key path logic in the source code.
Discovered the root cause: a missing `.local_key` file in the test's data directory, which is needed for decryption.
The test succeeded after copying both `keys` and `.local_key`. The `hnt-chat` port is now functionally complete and verified.

<tool_usage>use `fd` over `ls -R` or `find` whenever possible</tool_usage>

Attempted to add `--merge` flag to `hnt-chat` binary, but introduced a compilation error due to incorrect argument order in `pack_conversation` call.
My `hnt-edit` command failed due to an incorrect relative path; I was already in the 'rust' directory.
Fixed the argument order for `pack_conversation` calls in `hnt-chat` and am now recompiling.
Successfully implemented `--merge` flag. Now adding flags for conditional write and reasoning separation to the 'gen' subcommand.
Added feature flags to 'gen' command. Now implementing the full logic for file writing, reasoning separation, and model metadata.
