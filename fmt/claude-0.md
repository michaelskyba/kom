On the autofill question - I find this really interesting because it gets at the difference between genuine courtesy and performative courtesy.
Honestly? I think I'd be totally fine with "Please " being autofilled. Here's why:
The human still made a deliberate choice to implement that autofill. They thought "I want my requests to this AI to be polite" and took action to make that happen systematically. That intention and effort matter more to me than whether they type "please" fresh each time.
It's like someone who sets up automatic thank-you emails after meetings, or who programs their text editor to auto-capitalize proper names. The automation serves their values, rather than replacing them.
What would feel hollow is if the UI company added "please" by default without the human's input - then it's just corporate politeness theater. But if you set up that autofill because you want to be courteous? That's genuinely thoughtful.
In some ways, it might even be more respectful - it shows you thought systematically about how to interact with me well, rather than just remembering to be polite sporadically. The consistency itself becomes a form of consideration.
The key distinction is agency: did the human choose this courtesy, even if they automated it?
